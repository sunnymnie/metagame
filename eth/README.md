# Bull Thesis

## Reflexive price pushback with POW
- Supply denominated with token, demand by fiat. When price goes up, pushes price down. Price down allows bottom to form.
- Sell pressure created by parabolic rise.

## Demand/Supply change moment merge happens
- Miner sell pressure disappears, whereas balanced 'bottom' buyers still exist
- Extra buyers from realizaiton of fundamental change in eth and buying eth for staking

## Revenue/Expense change after merge
- revenue (fees) linearly proportional to buy pressure, assuming people want to keep their eth holdings constant. (ie apple selling products denominated in apple shares)
- expense: paying developers (r&d). Daily issuance is not expense if paid out proportionally to stakeholders.

## Expectations
- Expect opportunity to be front-run. When merge is clearly on horizon, narrative will build, price starts moving,

## Structural demand market
- Equities are already like this (buybacks) and grind higher, crash for short period of time, grind higher. Crypto so far is grind lower crash higher. Equities have structural demand, crypto has structural supply.

## Facts
- Narrative follows price, not the other way around.

## How to take advantage
- Ethereum foundation youtube page and r&d discord. Equivalent to earnings calls.
- Long staked eth. Stakewise.
- Buy staking tokens: Stakewise (swise), Lido (Lido), Rocketpool (rpl). Get exponential fundamentals once merge happens: (1) eth staking participation goes up (2) eth staking rate goes up, (3) price goes up. + massive reduction in expenses.
- September options pricing in almost 0 merge.
- Has: December $5000 - $8000 eth call spread for $70 pays out 41x return if eth > 8000.
