# Thesis checklist

1. [x] Shadowfork this Thursday. If goes well, will set date for public testnet the Friday after this Friday. If that happens, the tech hurdle is done. (May 27th they set a date).
2. [ ] One of existing testnets will go through merge mid-June. (Robsten on June 8th)
3. [ ] One testnet merges at end of June
4. [ ] One testnet meres at mid of July.
5. [ ] Start talking about mainnet merge by the end of July.
6. [ ] Schedule merge August. 75% chance merge happens before September.


## When Merge is clearly on horizon + scheduled
- [ ] Price starts moving + narrative starts to build
- [ ] Eth gaining dominance + eth/btc ratio increasing

## Around the merge
- [ ] Eth flips bitcoin

## When Merge occurs
- [ ] multi-billion dollar eth buys for staking
- [ ] multi-billion dollar eth buys for fundamentals
- [ ] Maintains 5k eth burned/day
- [ ] 7% eth staking rate --> cause 4b buy pressure (assuming ~15% staking rate)


## Fundamentals
- [ ] Ether fees correspond to buy pressure as people want to maintain same wealth -- fees linear to buy pressure
