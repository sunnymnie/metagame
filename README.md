# Metagame v.2
Purpose is the same: finding the meta

## Strat general idea
Go long after pump for large caps during 'bull bursts'

### Define 'bull burst'
- past btc/eth price
- btc/eth ratio + rate
- number of top alts rising
- pct of binance tokens rising
- define end?

### Possible buying opportunities to explore
- past price pattern
  - find pump and find correction. see how strong correct holds for first few hours
  - find how much volatility at top of pump / max pump price
  - create algorithm to detect /v-
- relative performance
  - inverse btprinter but add more holding time and maybe delay for buy
  - top 3 price performer for past 6 hours, check every hour
- dead simple criteria
  - buy basket of top gainers once 'bull burst' is recognized
